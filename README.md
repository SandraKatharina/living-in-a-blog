### Goal

Goal is to transfer the main idea from the former project "Travel Blog" made with pure Javascript, HTML and CSS into a **React App**.

While working on the project the focus is on _"thinking of components as building blocks"_, â€“ one of the many great parts of modern frontend web frameworks.

This project is part of the curriculum of the Full-Stack Web Development program at [Hamburg Coding School](https://hamburgcodingschool.com/).
