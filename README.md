# living-in-a-blog : Travel Blog in React 

This project is part of the curriculum of the Full-Stack Web Development program at [Hamburg Coding School](https://hamburgcodingschool.com/).

## Goal

Goal is to transfer the main idea from a former project made with pure Javascript, HTML and CSS into a **React App**.

While working on the project the focus should be on *"thinking of components as building blocks"*, â€“ one of the many great parts of modern frontend web frameworks.
