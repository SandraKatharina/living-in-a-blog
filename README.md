# living-in-a-blog : Travel Blog in React

##This project is part of the curriculum of the Full-Stack Web Development program at Hamburg Coding School.
Goal

Goal is to transfer the main idea from your last project "The Travel Blog", made with pure Javascript, HTML and CSS into a React App.

While working on the project remind yourself of "thinking of components as building blocks", â€“ one of the many great parts of modern frontend web frameworks.
